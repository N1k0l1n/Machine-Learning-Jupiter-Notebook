    "# Singular Value decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix into a rotation, followed by a rescaling followed by another rotation. It generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix with an orthonormal eigenbasis to any m × n matrix. It is related to the polar decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the singular value decomposition of an m × n complex matrix M is a factorization of the form :\n",
    "* M = UΣV*,\n",
    "where:  \n",
    "- U is m × n complex unitary matrix, \n",
    "- Σ is an m × n rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal,\n",
    "- V is an m × n complex unitary matrix, \n",
    "- and V∗ is the conjugate transpose of V. \n",
    "Such decomposition always exists for any complex matrix. If M is real, then U and V can be guaranteed to be real orthogonal matrices;"
