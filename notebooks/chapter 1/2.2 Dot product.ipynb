    "# The Dot Product\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have two vectors (say, *x* and *y) with the same length n*, we can calculate the dot product between them. This is annotated several different ways, including the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* x * y\n",
    "\n",
    "* xT * y\n",
    "\n",
    "* (x,y)\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless which notation you use (I prefer the first), the calculation is the same; we calculate products in an element-wise fashion and then sum reductively across the products to a scalar value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product is ubiquitous in deep learning: It is performed at every artificial neuron in a deep neural network, which may be made up of millions (or orders of magnitude more) of these neurons."
