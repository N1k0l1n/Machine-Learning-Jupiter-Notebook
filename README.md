# TensorFlow.js Learning NoteBook

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for learning TensorFlow.js, a JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser and on Node.js.

## Overview

TensorFlow.js provides a flexible and accessible platform for machine learning development in JavaScript. This project aims to provide a structured learning path using Jupyter Notebooks, covering various aspects of TensorFlow.js, including:

- Basics of TensorFlow.js
- Building and training neural networks
- Transfer learning and fine-tuning pre-trained models
- Deploying models in web applications
- Integration with other JavaScript libraries and frameworks
